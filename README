Cinnamon is not API stable, extensions work only against a very
specific version of the cinnamon, usually the same as this package (see
"configure --version").

Extensions
==========

  Lets you manage your workspaces more easily, assigning a specific workspace to
  each application as soon as it creates a window, in a manner configurable with a
  GSettings key.

  (i.e. pendrives)

   It hides completely when the Trash is empty.

  a native one. Lets the user rotate the laptop monitor and open
  display preferences quickly.
